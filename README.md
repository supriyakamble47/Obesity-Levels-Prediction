# Obesity-Levels-Prediction

In an era marked by an increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated health complications, there exists a pressing need to develop effective strategies for the prediction and prevention of this worldwide crisis. Predicting obesity levels, and understanding the factors contributing to this complex condition, are crucial steps in addressing this epidemic. We aim to introduce critical research and prediction of obesity levels through data mining, with a focus on the role of lifestyle and health factors. Through our exploratory data analysis, we examine how various features in our dataset are interconnected, aiming to reveal the underlying patterns, relationships and deviations that contribute to the development of obesity. These insights play a pivotal role in forecasting obesity levels in individuals and facilitating early detection and prevention, ultimately enabling more personalized healthcare approaches. Additionally, this process enhances our scientific comprehension of obesity, providing valuable insights that can aid researchers and healthcare professionals in refining their understanding of the condition. This, in turn, can lead to the development of more effective strategies for preventing and treating obesity, making a substantial contribution to the community's well-being.
